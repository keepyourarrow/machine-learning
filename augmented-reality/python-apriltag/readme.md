# Apriltags
1. A black square with a white foreground and a specific human made shape(not a natural shape)
1. We have a little bit of a black background surrounding the shape so its easier to detect it.
1. Even with an object rotated,scaled or having a worse lightning, it'd still be possible to detect the object.
1. Its very easy to make April Tags (printer)
1. April Tags are a type of fiducial marker
1. There are a lot of use cases for April tags.

## What is fiducial marker
1. Something that we mark the area with to let us(or the computer) know what to pay attention to(or what to ignore)


## Where do we use April Tags
1. Commonly seen in robotics to easier spot a robot.
1. To detect the distance between the camera and an object.

## Similar to QR code
1. April tags hold way less data however, 4-12 bits compared to 3 KB that QR code holds
1. April Tag holds less data than QR code, but that's intended as that way its easier to detect the objects

## When to use QR code vs April Tags
1. If you want to store data = QR code
1. If you want to detect objects = April tags

## Example
1. A machine in a warehouse navigating with the help of April tags.
1. If it sees a *stop* marker, it will stop, if it sees a *turn left* marker, it will turn left
